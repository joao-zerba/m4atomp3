# m4atomp3
This is a simple script made with python that someone can convert m4a audio files (specially for itunes songs) to a more standard format - mp3 - keeping the music metadata and quality. It uses ffmpeg as the engine.

FFMPEG - download and extract the file (ffmpeg-git-full.7zm, from https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) to C:\ffmpeg\ first. Then as an input give the folder that have your m4a songs.
